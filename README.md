# Coin Flip App

This is a simple React application that simulates a coin toss. Users can click on the coin image to flip it and receive a "Heads" or "Tails" result, which is updated after the animation completes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **App Component**: Serves as the root component and renders the `CoinFlip` component.

2. **CoinFlip Component**: Handles the coin flip logic, updates the display based on the result, and manages the flipping animation.

### Files

- `App.js`: Main entry point of the application, responsible for rendering the `CoinFlip` component.
- `CoinFlip.jsx`: Contains the logic for coin toss and the UI components necessary for interacting with the user.
- `CoinFlip.css`: Styles for the coin flip component, including animations and layout.

## Features

- **Interactive Coin Flip**: Click the coin image to initiate a flip.
- **Random Outcome**: Using JavaScript's `Math.random()`, the coin can land on either "Heads" or "Tails" randomly.
- **Animated Coin Spin**: Flip the coin with a smooth 3D animation.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, maintaining usability and appearance.

## Installation and Usage

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd coin-flip-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Styling and Animations

The application uses CSS to provide a visually appealing user interface with a gradient background, shadow effects, and smooth transitions. The `.coin` class provides a dynamic hover effect and simulates the flipping action using CSS keyframes.

The `index.css` and `CoinFlip.css` files contains all the styling rules, ensuring that the application remains responsive and visually consistent.

## Future Improvements

- Add more coin designs or themes for user customization.
- Include a scoreboard to track the number of heads and tails flipped.
- Allow users to set the coin flipping duration or adjust animation styles.
